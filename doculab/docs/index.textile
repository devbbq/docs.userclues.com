h3. Getting Started

We suggest starting with our "Quick Start Guide", specifically one of the following pages:

* "UserClues Overview":/overview - get quickly oriented to see how to make the most out of UserCLues
* "Terminology":/terminology - learn the terms we'll use throughout these docs
* "Getting Started":/getting-started - a guide that helps you get up and running
