When you create a profile for your App, UserClues will assign it an @API Authentication Key@.

Both the "Reporting":api-reporting-introduction and "Tracking":api-tracking-introduction APIs utilize @Basic HTTP Authentication@ to authenticate the request and determine which App the API should reference when performing its magic. Therefore, every request made to the API must include the following credentials:

pre. Username: [Your API Authentication Key]
Password: [Blank]
